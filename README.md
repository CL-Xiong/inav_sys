## terminologies
### direction cosine matrix:
% the direction matrix approach.
% The direction cosines representation the attitude of the body frame
% relative to the global frame is specified by a 3x3 rotation matrix C,
% in which each column is a unit vector alone one of the body axes
% specified in terms of the global axes.
% for more info see ch6.1, pp21 "an introduction to inertial navigation"
